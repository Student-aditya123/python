# ****Variables and DataTypes****
# type() and input()

# ques.1 Write a python program to add two numbers. 
# a = int(input("enter the first number: "))
# b = int(input("enter the second number: "))
# print(f"Sum of two numbers {a} and {b} = {a+b}")

# ques.2 Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z. 
# z=2;
# n=int(input("enter the number:"))
# print(f"remainder: {n%z}")

# ques.3 Check the type of variable assigned using input () function. 
# c=2
# d=2.45
# e=True
# g="aditya"
# print(type(c))
# print(type(d))
# print(type(e))
# print(type(g))

# ques.4 Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than 
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80 
# a=34
# b=80
# if a==b:
#     print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
# elif a>b:
#     print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")   
# else:
#     print(f"{b} is greater than  {a}")     

# ques.5 Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user. 
# n1=int(input(f"enter the first number:"))
# n2=int(input(f"enter the second number:")) 
# average = (n1+n2)//2
# print(average)

# ques.6 Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user. 
# num=int(input(f"enter the number:"))
# print(f"square of number {num} is {num*num}")
